The principal id is an optional field, which can be set by business logic to the user id.
The principal id should be some technical user id and not something like an email, as it might be logged.
It is recommended to use the message principal id for any authentication/authorization, because this way, there is no need to look into the message payload, which might be encrypted or not present.

The principal id is propagated down - like the trace id - in the whole process flow. So it will be available in subscriptions and function invocations.

It is highly recommended to use schema validation for any input and output of a command.
If you use the PURISTA CLI for adding commands, a `schema.ts` and `type.ts` file is generated.  
The payload schema is already added to the command builder.

```typescript
import {  // [!code ++]
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  // [!code ++]
} from './schema.js' // [!code ++]

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) // [!code ++]
```

By adding a payload schema, the command input will be validated during runtime and typescript types are set during development.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.015566322f,

The concept of builders stems from the desire to efficiently access and process information about services, commands, subscriptions, events, endpoints, and more, in a manner conducive to sharing and automation. Hence, PURISTA offers the capability to export information from service builders as easily serializable JSON objects. These objects can be saved, shared, and processed as needed.

Exporting this information is a straightforward process.

```typescript
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { join } from 'node:path'

import { exportServiceDefinitions } from '@purista/core'

import { pingV1Service } from './service/ping/v1/index.js'
import { fooV1Service } from './service/foo/v1/index.js'
import { barV1Service } from './service/bar/v1/index.js'

const exportDefinitions = async () => {

  const serviceBuilders = [pingV1Service, fooV1Service, barV1Service]

  const definitions = await exportServiceDefinitions(serviceBuilders)

  await writeFile(join(process.cwd(), 'defintions.json'), JSON.stringify(definitions, null ,2))
}
```

This small script exports the full service definitions of the provided service builders.  
It includes information about each command and each subscription, including the shape of inputs, outputs, custom events.  

The shape of the data looks like this:

```typescript
const definitions = {
  version: 'X.Y.Z', // the PURISTA version used to generate the definition
  services: {
    [serviceName]: {
      [serviceVersion]: {

If a output transform is set, it will be executed as very last step in the message handling.  
The output transformer has it's own schema, which will validate the returned value of the transform function.  
If the schema validation fails, an error response will automatically created and sent back to the caller. The command guards and the command function are not executed, if this validations fails.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .setTransformInput(z.string(), z.string(), async function (context, payload, parameter) {
      const payloadParsed = JSON.parse(payload)
      const parameterParsed = JSON.parse(parameter)
      return {
        payload: payloadParsed,
        parameter:parameterParsed,
      }
    })
  .setTransformOutput(z.string(), async function (context, payload, _parameter) { // [!code ++]
    return JSON.stringify(payload) // [!code ++]
  }) // [!code ++]
  .setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
    // implement your logic here
  }) 
```

::: info Parameter
In the transform output function, the parameter value will be provided.
This allows to write more dynamic output transformer function which might transform a response only if it is necessary.
:::

If the transform function itself is throwing an error, other than `HandledError`, a `UnhandledError` with status `Internal Server Error` is sent back to the caller.

The transform function must return the final raw payload.
Because of this, the output transformer must be defined after the command function schemas.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.050423127f, 0.0069257715f, -0.15850562f, -0.091807425f,

The service builder is able to create a new instance of a service.
The most minimal version is, to call the `getInstance` method of the service builder and to provide a event bridge instance as first parameter.

```typescript
const myService = await myServiceV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge)
```

At this point, we've created a service instance, but the instance is not fully connected to the event bridge and has not announced the existence of the commands and subscriptions.

We need to start the service, to get a fully working service instance:

```typescript
const myService = await myServiceV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge)
await myService.start() // [!code ++]

There are two reasons for this 2-step-behaviour.

1. The regular typescript constructur can't be an async function, which makes it hard to handle async method calls - like sending info messages to the event bridge.

In case you need to use query parameters, you can use zhe `addQueryParameters` method of the command definition builder.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .exposeAsHttpEndpoint('GET', 'ping')
  .addQueryParameters( // [!code ++]
      {  // [!code ++]
        name: 'param', // [!code ++]
        required: false // [!code ++]
      },  // [!code ++]
      {   // [!code ++]
        neededParam: true, // [!code ++]
        name: 'required' // [!code ++]
      }  // [!code ++]
    )  // [!code ++]
  .setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
    // implement your logic here
  })
```

Query parameters are provided in the parameter object.  
Because of this, you need to add them into the parameter input schema object.

```typescript
export const theServiceV1PingInputParameterSchema = extendApi(
  z.object({
    id: extendApi(z.string(), { title: 'The id path parameter', example: 'some_id' } )
    param: extendApi( // [!code ++]
        z.string().optional(),  // [!code ++]
        { title: 'The optional query parameter param', example: 'some_id' } // [!code ++]
      ) // [!code ++]
    neededParam: extendApi( // [!code ++]
        z.string().optional(),  // [!code ++]
        { title: 'The required query parameter neededParam', example: 'some_id' } // [!code ++]
      ) // [!code ++]
  }),
  { title: 'The parameter object' },
)
```

::: info Quer parameters are strings
Query parameters are always provided as string type.  
Conversation must be implemented via transformers (prefferred) or inside the business logic.

PURISTA also allows you to define AfterGuards. However, because the command function has already finished executing by the time an AfterGuard runs, the potential uses for AfterGuards are somewhat restricted.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .setTransformInput(z.string(), z.string(), async function (context, payload, parameter) {
      const payloadParsed = JSON.parse(payload)
      const parameterParsed = JSON.parse(parameter)
      return {
        payload: payloadParsed,
        parameter:parameterParsed,
      }
    })
  .setTransformOutput(z.string(), async function (context, payload, _parameter) {
    return JSON.stringify(payload)
  })
  .setBeforeGuardHooks({ // [!code ++]

::: info Parameter
In the AfterGuard function, the parameter value will be provided.

As the first step, we will need to set up a service. This can be done by using the service builder.

::: code-group

```typescript [myServiceV1ServiceBuilder.ts]
import { ServiceBuilder, ServiceInfoType } from '@purista/core'

export const myServiceInfo = {
  serviceName: 'MyService',
  serviceVersion: '1',
  serviceDescription: 'my service',
} as const satisfies ServiceInfoType

export const myServiceV1ServiceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder(myServiceInfo)
```

:::

::: tip 💪 Use strong types
Use `as const satisfies ServiceInfoType = {...}` instead of `export const myServiceInfo: ServiceInfoType = {...}` for better types.
:::

::: warning ⚠️ Avoid cycling dependencies
The basic service definition (name, version, config) and adding the commands and subscriptions should be done in separate files, to prevent cycling dependencies.
The command and subscription builders are generated from the basic service builder, to propagate config & custom classes correctly.

To be able to build real world systems, you will need to send events, which will be consumed by subscriptions or third party providers. The sender does/should not need to know, who is consuming this information.

To define a custom event, an event name and a event schema must be set. The command and subscription builders provide the `canEmit` method, which should be used.

Emitting custom events is quite easy. The function context and the subscription context containing a helper function `emit`.
This async `emit` function has two parameters. The event name and the optional payload to be sent.  
The event name and type is automatically inherited by the definition done with `canEmit`.

Example:

```typescript

.canEmit('MyEventName', z.object({ some: z.string() }))
.setCommandFunction(async function ({ emit }, payload, _param) {
  await emit('MyEventName', { some: 'Payload' })
}

```

The emitted message will have the current service (name & version & function/subscription-name) as sender address.
But there is no receiver defined at all. Emitting a custom event will be broadcasted without a specific receiver. It is up to you, to ensure, that there is somebody who listens for this event.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.03146247f, 0.10118155f, -0.17088667f, -0.024468478f, 0.06878322f,

In PURISTA, we understand the importance of performance. However, certain features like using messages for communication, checking data during runtime, and handling errors come with trade-offs in performance. Despite this, we prioritize these features over things like maximizing raw speed for processing HTTP requests.

Building software with PURISTA offers great flexibility in scaling. This means applications made with PURISTA can handle large amounts of work in various ways. Because of this flexibility, applications built with PURISTA can deliver excellent overall performance. They also offer high reliability when things go wrong and interesting options for recovering from errors.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.035513703f, 0.06792352f, -0.1580673f,

Error handling is one of the essentials of software development.
But it's not easy - especially when your complexity is growing.

By implementing only happy path, without proper error handling, maintenance will quickly become a nightmare.

PURISTA is build with error handling in mind and helps developers to build understandable, predictable and secure applications.

Error handling is done in different layers of your application, and errors are also unified for better error handling.

PURISTA has deeply integrated support for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
This provides an industrial standard way to keep track of errors and issues.
See [Logging](./logging.md) and [Tracing](../4_open_telemetry/) section.

Errors are automatically added to the OpeneTelemetry trace.

There are two error types provided by PURISTA - `HandledError` and `UnhandledError`.
Both types are logged automatically as soon as they get thrown.

Using these both error types ensures, that we have a defined error structure.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.027102876f, 0.0024711518f, -0.141574f, -0.07103168f, 0.060348988f,

Secret stores are provided to services during instance creation.

```typescript
const secretStore = new DaprSecretStore({ secretStoreName: 'local-secret-store' })

const myService = await myV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge, {
    secretStore,
  })
```

The secret store is provided inside the `context` of command functions and subscription functions.
It can be used like this:

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload) {

  // set a config
  await context.configs.setSecret('secret_key', 'super_secret_string_only')
  await context.configs.setSecret('other_secret', 'confidential')

  // get a config
  const myConfig = await context.configs.getConfig('secret_key', 'other_secret')
  console.log(myConfig) // outputs: { secret_key: \"super_secret_string_only\", other_secret: \"confidential\" }

  // remove a config
  await context.configs.removeConfig('port')
})
```

::: info
Config stores per default:

- enabled getter
- disabled setter
- disabled removal

You need to explicit enable via config if needed

The idea of having transformers, follows the PURISTA principal to separate things and decouple business logic from technical needs.
Transformers are responsible to convert the raw message payload in/to the data shape & type, the command function is expecting.

Use transformers for:

- converting data format (example xml to js object to xml)
- decrypt and encrypt the payload (end-to-end encryption)', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.0074185794f, -0.0016597089f, -0.12346829f, -0.10490581f, 0.05345015f, -0.07612245f,

You can simply export the current configuration.

```typescript
const config = {
  definitionPath: './definitions',
  outputPath: './dist',
  httpClient: {
    buildAs: 'both',
    clientName: 'HttpClient',
  },
}

const clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder(config)
await clientBuilder.writeConfig()

clientBuilder.destroy()
```

The `.writeConfig` method has an optional parameter.

**👎 BAD PRACTICE**

Do not catch and handle only *some* errors.

```typescript
try{
  const result = db.create(payload)
} catch(err) {
  if (isConstraintViolation(err)) {
    // give the client a propper answer, that he tries to insert a record,
    // but a record with same id already exist
    throw new HandledError(StatusCode.Conflict, 'entity with same id already exist')
  }
  // ANY NON-CONSTRAINT-ERROR is swallowed, because it is catched, but not handled
  // if it is some other error you never get informed about it
  // it will not throw and will not be logged
}
```

**👍 GOOD PRACTICE**

Handle the things you can, and throw the rest.

```typescript
try{
  const result = db.create(payload)
} catch(error) {
  if (isConstraintViolation(error)) {
    // give the client a propper answer, that he tries to insert a record,
    // but a record with same id already exist
    throw new HandledError(StatusCode.Conflict, 'entity with same id already exist')
  }
  // use static class method .from() to keep the stack trace!
  throw UnhandledError.from(err, StatusCode.InternalServerError)
}

You can provide the expected return type in the short hand functions.
The response will be automatically JSON-decoded if the header `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`.
Otherwise it will return the plain response as string.

In case the request fails or is returning an HTTP error, the methods will throw a `UnhandledError`.
This error object will contain in the data object:

- the HTTP status code
- method
- url
- path
- headers (array)
- response (string or JSON parse result)

As an example, we will simply count the unhandled errors with the Prometheus client.

```typescript
// observer.ts
import client from 'prom-client'

export const collectData = (serviceInstance: Service) => {
  // Create a Registry which registers the metrics
  const register = new client.Registry()
  // Enable the collection of default metrics
  client.collectDefaultMetrics({ register })
  // Add a default label which is added to all metrics
  register.setDefaultLabels({
    serviceName: theService.info.serviceName,
    serviceVersion: theService.info.serviceVersion,
  })

  // create a counter
  const counter = new client.Counter({
    name: 'unhandled_error_count',
    help: 'metric_help',
  });

  serviceInstace.on(ServiceEventsNames.CommandUnhandledError, ()=> {
    counter.inc()
  })

  serviceInstace.on(ServiceEventsNames.SubscriptionUnhandledError, ()=> {
    counter.inc()
  })

  return register
}
```

```typescript
// main or index file
// ...
import { collectData } from './observer'
// ...
// your regular instance creation an existing code
// ...

const register = collectData(serviceInstance)

// if you use the @purista/k8s-sdk
// expose the metrics like this
server.router.add('GET', '/metrics', async (_request, response) => {
  response.setHeader('content-type', register.contentType)
  response.end(await register.metrics())
})

```

As you can see, things are nicely separated and structured.

The secret store serves two main purposes.

Firstly, it ensures that secrets have a short lifespan and are only accessible when needed in your implementation. Secrets should not be included in general service configurations and should be stored securely.

Secondly, the secret store interface allows for the use of different solutions without the need for vendor-specific code implementation in your business logic.

Essentially, the secret store offers a straightforward interface to a key-value store, where both keys and values are strings.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.0019435517f,

In the realm of PURISTA, our ethos revolves around a set of fundamental principles, ensuring the robust implementation of business logic:

1. **Isolation and Separation**: Business logic implementation adheres strictly to the principles of isolation and separation. The "outside world" is viewed as a black box with well-defined interfaces.

2. **Service Specificity**: Each service is dedicated to a single entity, maintaining clarity and focus within its domain.

3. **Isolated Commands and Subscriptions**: Commands and subscriptions operate in isolation, interacting with the external environment solely through known interfaces. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and minimizes dependencies.

4. **Runtime Validation**: Every input and output exchanged with a command or subscription undergoes rigorous validation during runtime, enhancing system reliability and security.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: Following the principle of separation of concerns, each component within PURISTA is designed with a clear and distinct purpose, fostering maintainability and scalability.

In essence, PURISTA embodies a steadfast commitment to excellence, ensuring the rapid delivery of business value while upholding the highest standards of reliability and flexibility.', textTemplate:

If an input validation fails (parameter or payload validation), the validation error is transformed into a HandledError with status **400 BAD REQUEST** and a more specific error detail is available in error response data object.
This is ok, because the one who invoked the function, does already know the input data, and we are safe to give some hints, what data is violating the schema.

PURISTA is passing the `issues` property if Zod error instances into the `data` field. See [Zod - Error handling](https://zod.dev/?id=error-handling).

Stores in PURISTA are an abstraction layer.  
They provide a unified interface for handling configurations, secrets and states, without the need to know the actual implementation or used product.

A unit test for a command looks like this:

```typescript
import { getEventBridgeMock, getLoggerMock, safeBind } from '@purista/core'
import { createSandbox } from 'sinon'

import { pingV1Service } from '../../pingV1Service'
import { fooCommandBuilder } from './fooCommandBuilder'
import type { PingV1FooInputParameter, PingV1FooInputPayload } from './types'

describe('service Ping version 1 - command foo', () => {
  let sandbox = createSandbox()
  beforeEach(() => {
    sandbox = createSandbox()
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    sandbox.restore()
  })

  test('does not throw', async () => {
    const service = await pingV1Service.getInstance(
      getEventBridgeMock(sandbox).mock, 
      { 
        logger: getLoggerMock(sandbox).mock 
      }
    )

    // use safeBind to keep the typescript types
    const foo = safeBind(fooCommandBuilder.getCommandFunction(), service)
    // alternative without
    // const foo = fooCommandBuilder.getCommandFunction().bind(service)

    const payload: PingV1FooInputPayload = undefined

    const parameter: PingV1FooInputParameter = {}

    // get a mocked command context
    const context = fooCommandBuilder.getCommandContextMock(payload, parameter, sandbox)

    // execute the command including the validations and hooks
    const result = await foo(context.mock, payload, parameter)

    expect(result).toStrictEqual({ foo: 'foo' })
  })
})
```


The intersting part is the mocked command context.  
The `getCommandContextMock`method of the command builder returns an object, which has two entries.

The `mock` entry is the mocked context, which can be passed to the command function.

The `stubs` entry contains [Sinon stubs](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/stubs/) for every context method.  

As an example, a command might invoke other services and we need to mock the returned data.

```typescript
const context = fooCommandBuilder.getCommandContextMock(payload, parameter, sandbox)

context.stubs.service.OtherService[1].otherCommand.resolves('mock data')

PURISTA has the concept of builders to define services, functions and subscriptions. But why is this needed?

There is a need to define services, attach functions and subscriptions. And each function or subscription has also properties, configurations, options and so on.

One simple option would be, to have some code generators. This is a solid concept, and very often used in frameworks. But it has some disadvantages. You get some bootstrap code, and align, extent, and change the generated code. You will also need some more or less fixed folder structure, which reduces the freedom of developers.

While code generation in general is a great tool, they are not the best choice for our needs here.
PURISTA tries to be decoupled from the underlaying system and infrastructure. So, we might need a way to convert our settings into a specific architecture, for a specific infrastructure or cloud provider. This conversion might be on the fly. So we will need to access and interpret the setup programmatically. Also, we want to avoid manual configurations and manual steps as much as possible. They are time-consuming and error-prone.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.008712754f, 0.055947613f, -0.1481316f, -0.10076468f, 0.026340934f, -0.059908837f, -0.031604007f,

To allow a more flexible way of tracking, monitoring or alerting, you might want to use some external services like [sentry](https://sentry.io/) or you like to programmatically react on errors and issues.
For example, automatically open a issue in your ticket system.

To allow a flexible and decoupled way, a service emits the following events:

- `handled-subscription-error` emitted when a subscription throws a HandledError
- `handled-command-error` emitted when a command throws a HandledError
- `unhandled-subscription-error` emitted when a subscription throws an error other than a HandledError
- `unhandled-command-error` emitted when a command throws an error other than a HandledError

This means, you can attach your logic like opening a issue in your ticket system, instead of deeply integrate it into your business logic.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding:

Parameter must be an object.  
For example, if you expose your command via REST-API, query parameters and url parameters are passed to the command function as parameter entries.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema, // [!code ++]
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema) // [!code ++]
```

The embedded client is an abstraction of a client.  
If you start building an application, it might be a good starting point to build it as monolith in a single repository, to keep the overhead low and to be able to deliver features quickly.  
But at some point you might want to split the monoloth into different, independent parts.  
Here, an embedded client acts as placeholder, which can be swapped out by a real client for distributed systems.

A good example, where this is the preferred way: [GraphQL server](../exposing_endpoints/graphql_mutation_and_query.md)', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.03119737f, 0.04235362f,

In PURISTA applications, there are two general ways to make configuration data accessable for your commands and subscriptions.

You can provide conffigurations via the [service configuration](../service/add-a-service-config.md) or via config stores.  
Both is valid and you might ask why and when to use which option.

Configrations, which are necessarly needed to be able to start a service and which is not changeable during runtime, must be provided via the service configration. As an example: database configurations, setting of timeouts and similar.

Configurations, like urls of third party provides credential user names (not passwords!), which you might also want to change during runtime, should be stored in config stores.

|   | config store  | service config  |
|---|---|---|
| typed*                  | no  | yes  |
| validated*              |  no | yes  |
| changes during runtime  | possible  | no  |
| distributed/shared      | possible  | no  |

Using config stores, allows to manage configuration, without the need to restart instances, and to use solutions like AWS Parameter Store, without directly coupling vendor specific solutions to business code.

Also, if a command or subscriptions needs further configurations like urls of external services, than the config store is a good place to persist this information.

The config store is a simple interface to a key-value-store. The key must be a string and the value can be any type which can be serialized via JSON stringify/parse.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.012901395f, 0.08163209f, -0.17051207f,

![Add service with cli](/graphic/add_service.png)

A service is a logical group of functions and subscriptions. This is where the domain driven aspect comes in.
In our example, we will use the classic example - Users.

A service can provide costum configurations, which will be available in commands and subscriptions.

In general, a service itself should not contain any logic. It should only act as a logical container for commands and subscriptions.
Also, services should not hold state data.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.022196412f, 0.0055277254f, -0.08501694f, -0.052437615f, 0.0026825839f, -0.02909942f, 0.060607586f,

In general, a service itself should not contain any logic. Its role should be limited to serving as a logical container, providing functionality defined and handled by PURISTA.

The primary reason for this is that command and subscription functions become tightly coupled to the service and the states of an actual service instance. This not only increases complexity and complicates unit testing but also makes it challenging to deploy single functions as Function as a Service (FaaS) and to scale operations.

However, there may be exceptional cases where it is sensible to have a custom class. One such example is when your service needs to function as an adapter or gateway to a third-party solution, and there is no straightforward solution at the infrastructure level.

In such cases, you acknowledge and accept that your service runs as a continuous instance 24/7 and cannot be deployed as a FaaS.

Example:

::: code-group

```typescript [CustomUserClass.ts]
import { CustomMessage, EBMessageAddress, EBMessageType, getNewTraceId, Service } from '@purista/core'
import { customConnect, CustomProvider } from 'custom-provider'

import { UserServiceV1Config } from './userServiceConfig'

export class CustomUserClass extends Service<UserServiceV1Config> {
  private customProvider?: CustomProvider
  async start() {
    super.start()

    // your custom logic
    // connect to a third-party provider
    this.customProvider = await customConnect(this.config)

    // listen for data and emit it as PURISTA custom event to the event bridge
    this.customProvider.on('data', async (data: unknown) => {
      const sender: EBMessageAddress = {
        serviceName: this.info.serviceName,
        serviceVersion: this.info.serviceVersion,
        serviceTarget: '',
      }

      const message: Readonly<Omit<CustomMessage<unknown>, 'id' | 'instanceId' | 'timestamp'>> = Object.freeze({
        messageType: EBMessageType.CustomMessage,
        traceId: getNewTraceId(),
        contentType: 'application/json',
        contentEncoding: 'utf-8',
        sender,
        eventName: 'myCustomEven',
        payload: data,
      })
      await this.eventBridge.emitMessage(message)
    })
  }

  async destroy() {
    await this.customProvider.close()
    super.destroy()
  }
}
```

:::

and than add it in the base service builder file:

::: code-group

```typescript [userV1ServiceBuilder.ts]
import { ServiceBuilder, ServiceInfoType } from '@purista/core'

import { generalUserServiceInfo } from '../generalUserServiceInfo'
import { CustomUserClass } from './CustomUserClass'
import { userServiceV1ConfigSchema } from './userServiceConfig'

export const userServiceInfo = {
  serviceVersion: '1',
  ...generalUserServiceInfo,
} as const satisfies ServiceInfoType

// create a service builder instance and assign service config schema and default config.

export const userV1ServiceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder(userServiceInfo)
  .setConfigSchema(userServiceV1ConfigSchema)
  .setDefaultConfig({ myOption: 'something' })
  .setCustomClass(CustomUserClass) // [!code ++]
```

:::

In the example above, the service acts as a gateway to push data from third-party providers into the event bridge/PURISTA part.
You might want to have a subscription or command here, to push data in the opposite direction.
To move data from the event bridge/PURISTA part to the third-party provider, create a subscription or command like this:

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function(_context,payload) {
  const response = await this.customProvider.send(payload)
  return {
    response
  }
})

```

::: tip
If you need to implement a custom service class, try to avoid adding many subscriptions or commands here.
Reduce it to the bare minimum, and consider an additional class for commands and subscriptions, which do not directly need the custom functionality.

A core feature of PURISTA is the ability to implement event driven systems.  
Because of this, you can mark a command response as an event. Subscriptions can subscribe to a certain event.

The command builder provides the `setSuccessEventName(name: string)` method.  
If you set an event name, the output of a command be seen as an event.

```typescript
const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder.getCommandBuilder(
  'functionName',
  'some function description',
  'functionEventEmitted'  // [!code ++]
)
```

alternatively

```typescript
const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder.getCommandBuilder(
  'functionName',
  'some function description',
).setSuccessEventName('functionEventEmitted') // [!code ++])
```

::: info Event naming
Event names should be in the past tense.

Config stores are provided to the services during instance creation.

```typescript
const configStore = new DaprConfigStore({ configStoreName: 'local-config-store' })

const myService = await myV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge, {
    configStore,
  })
```

The config store is provided inside the `context` of command functions and subscription functions.
It can be used like this:

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload) {

  // set a config
  await context.configs.setConfig('port', 8080)

  // get a config
  const myConfig = await context.configs.getConfig('hostUrl', 'port')
  console.log(myConfig) // outputs: { hostUrl: \"http://example.com\", port: 8080 }

  // remove a config
  await context.configs.removeConfig('port')
})
```

::: tip Use schemas to validate
A production ready approach is, to validate the result of store getters and setters against a schema.
It validates the input or return values and gives you proper types for further usage in one step.
As an example:
:::

```typescript
setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload) {

  const configSchema = z.object({
    hostUrl: z.string().url(),
    port: z.number().int().min(1).max(99999),
  })

  const result = await context.configs.getConfig('hostUrl', 'port')

  // myConfig now has proper types and is technical valid
  const myConfig = configSchema.parse(result)

  console.log(myConfig) // outputs: { hostUrl: \"http://example.com\", port: 8080 }

})
```

::: info
Config stores per default have:

- enabled getter
- disabled setter
- disabled removal

This small code snipped can be used to create your client.

```typescript [generate.ts]
import { ClientBuilder } from '@purista/core'

const generate = async ()=> {
  const clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder()

  clientBuilder.on('error', (...args) => console.error(...args))
  clientBuilder.on('warn', (...args) => console.warn(...args))
  clientBuilder.on('info', (...args) => console.info(...args))
  clientBuilder.on('success', (...args) => console.info(...args))
  clientBuilder.on('start', (...args) => console.log(...args))

```

```json [purista.client.json]
{
  \"version\": \"1.11.0\",
  \"definitionPath\": \"./definitions\",

```

:::

Add your definitions in the `./definitions` subfolder.  

::: tip
In a monorepo, you can directly use the definitions via imports.

```typescript
import { pingV1Service } from './service/ping/v1/index.js' // [!code ++]
import { fooV1Service } from './service/foo/v1/index.js' // [!code ++]
import { barV1Service } from './service/bar/v1/index.js' // [!code ++]
// ....
// load the definitions from exported json files // [!code --]
const defnitions = await clientBuilder.loadDefinitionFiles() // [!code --]

// use definitions from imported service builders // [!code ++]
const serviceBuilders = [pingV1Service, fooV1Service, barV1Service] // [!code ++]
const definitions = await exportServiceDefinitions(serviceBuilders) // [!code ++]
// ....
```

:::

You can simply run this code:

```sh
tsx generate.ts

The trace id is a id, which will be used for one complete process.

As an example:

The Frontend makes a url request, which invokes a service function A. The service function A invokes a service function B.
Service function A is returning a result back to the frontend. There is also a subscription C which listens for success responses of service A.

The traceId will be the same for all the messages and responses between the frontend, different service functions and subscriptions.

This allows to track the whole flow.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.010150447f, 0.018211786f, -0.17401418f, -0.08828515f, 0.044026665f, 0.006269115f, 0.0073994673f,

PURISTA provides logging as integral part.
Per default, [pino](https://getpino.io/) is used under the hood as logging library.

This means, during development you are able to use [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) for better human readable console log output.

But you can in theory use any logging library. There is only the need to build a simple wrapper.
This wrapper should be a class which extends `Logger` from `@purista/core`. See `DefaultLogger.ts` in core package.

The logger is expected to log:

- serviceName
- serviceVersion
- serviceTarget (available logged in context of a command or subscription)
- principalId (if available)
- tenantId (if available)
- traceId (custom traceId)
- OpenTelemetry traces

When messages are logged - the message payload will be removed to prevent leaking of data.

To log errors with stacktrace correctly, you should log them as `err`.

```typescript
logger.error({ err }, 'my own error message')
```

You **should not use** `traceId`, `spanId`, `parentId`, `parentSpanId`, `traceFlags` or `principalId` as property of the logging object. This might overwrite automatically added log information.

Available log levels are `info`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `debug` and `trace`.

Internally, PURISTA tries to cover these use cases with different log levels:

- `info` = general information like used port, service status and so on
- `fatal` = if a service is unable to start at all
- `error` = if some unexpected/unhandled error occurs like a command function is throwing
- `warning` = if for example a http request fails because of input validation
- `debug` = general framework flow information which should not be logged in production
- `trace` = detailed raw data mainly of third party plugins

In production, log level `warn` is recommended.

Service instances will create a own logger

The service builder is a powerfull tool, to define a service. The builder helps to keep the code unified, clear & speakable and takes care of configs, types and so on.

To create a new service, please use the CLI command.

```bash
purista add service [serviceName]
```

This will generate all necessary files and structures for you.
In most cases, you only might want to add/change the service config or define resources for commands and subscriptions.

Adding commands and subscriptions can also be done via CLI, and does not require manual changes in the service files.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.009992629f, 0.08036635f,

There are several parts, where one setting or configuration is impacting a whole service. For example, the custom configuration for a service might change. You probably don't want to change several functions and subscriptions, only because you add a simple property.

Types are dynamically set and generated. You can take the input for a function as an example. You have set the input schema, which generates the input typescript type for your function. It also sets the type of message payload and maybe generates the OpenApi definition.

Now, if you add a input payload transform hook, the type of message payload and the OpenApi definition will change. The hook function itself will also have some input/output types.

There is a bunch of type definition stuff behind the scene, to ensure correct types, correct input and outputs. This improves speed during development, reduces the costs for maintaining code, and prevents bugs.

To get an idea, take a look at this diagram. This is a kind of typescript-type dependency graph. This is the stuff you would need to manage within your code and your brain, without builders.

::: warning Order matters
You must declare the input and output schemas before adding transforms, hooks and functions!
As you can see in the diagram above, they impact the input/output types of transforms, hooks and functions.
:::

There are currently 3 builders available.

A custom configuration relates to your business logic and your requirements. It is not used by PURISTA itself.
The custom service config will be available in all commands and subscriptions of this service via `this.config`.
Custom service configurations are one option to pass configuration values to commands and subscriptions.
But, you can also use stores.

Service configuration and stores addressing different data. Here is a table, that will help you to understand the differences.

_(*)_ by commands and subscriptions

For a custom configuration, you must define a [zod schema](https://zod.dev).
Example:

```typescript
export const userServiceV1ConfigSchema = z.object({
  myOption: z.string().optional()
})

export type UserServiceV1Config = z.input<typeof userServiceV1ConfigSchema>
```

As you can see, in the example a string option entry `myOption` is added. This field is marked as optional. Because of this, in the generated type `UserServiceV1Config`, the `myOption` is also optional.

Now, in the builder file `userV1ServiceBuilder.ts` in the same directory, typescript will complain on `.setDefaultConfig({})`.
Setting the default configuration, requires to set all root fields of the default configuration. The optional flag, only relates to the input, when you create a service instance and provide a service configuration.

::: tip
PURISTA follows the pattern, to always have default values, which can be overwritten, but only when there is a actual need for it.
:::

Because of this, you need to change it in the builder file `userV1ServiceBuilder.ts`.

```typescript
export const userV1ServiceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder(userServiceInfo)
  .setConfigSchema(userServiceV1ConfigSchema)
  .setDefaultConfig({
    myOption: 'something'
  })
```

::: warning Be aware
PURISTA does not deep merge configurations! If you have nested configurations, you should be aware of.

PURISTA comes with a default config store, which can be used as placeholder or connector to config files and environment variables.
In the constructor config, you can add a `config` property. The property must be from type object.

Example:

```typescript
const store = new DefaultConfigStore({
  enableGet: true,
  enableRemove: true,
  enableSet: true,
  config: {
    initialValue: 'initial',
    fromEnvVar: process.env.MY_VALUE;
  },
})

console.log(store.getState('initialValue')) // outputs: initial

The intention of guards is, to have the opportunity, to move authentication and authorization logic out of the main business logic.
A common example is, to add role and permission checks by using guards.

You can add multiple guards.  
Guards are executed in parallel.  
Guards should throw a `HandledError` with a proper status code, if the execution should be aborted.
If a guard is throwing an error, other than a `HandledError`, a `UnhandledError` with status `Internal Server Error` is sent back to the caller.  
A guard should not change values and does not return a value.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.049818303f, 0.06403089f, -0.18301947f, -0.029406255f, 0.025676502f, -0.04770163f,

One fantastic feature of PURISTA is that commands can trigger other commands from different services. This communication occurs through the event bridge.

This implies that the command initiating the action doesn't need to know where the other command is located.

To trigger another command, you must specify it in the command builder. By setting the input and output schemas, we ensure that data is handled correctly, preventing any unintended data from leaving or entering the command function.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const invokePayloadSchema = z.object({ // [!code ++]
 inputValue: z.string() // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]

const invokeParameterSchema = z.object({ // [!code ++]
 someInputParameter: z.string() // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]

const invokeResponseSchema = z.object({ // [!code ++]
  resultValue: z.string() // [!code ++]
}) // [!code ++]

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .canInvoke( // [!code ++]
    'OtherServiceName', // the service name to invoke // [!code ++]
    '1', // the service version to invoke // [!code ++]
    'otherCommandName', // the command name to invoke // [!code ++]
    invokeResponseSchema, // [!code ++]
    invokePayloadSchema,  // [!code ++]
    invokeParameterSchema,  // [!code ++]
    ) // [!code ++]
  .setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) { 

    const invokePayload = {
      inputValue: 'some input payload'
    }

     const invokeParameter = {
      someInputParameter: 'a parameter'
    }

    const invokeResult = context.service.OtherServiceName['1']
      .otherCommandName(invokePayload, invokeParameter)
    // invokeResult is type of { resultValue: string }
  })
```

You can use `canInvoke` as often as needed. Meaning you can invoke more than one other service command.

::: tip
In the invoke schemas define only necessary data. Especially the response schema should only contain data, which is used by the command function.

The client builder is very modular to give you the full control.  

```typescript
const config = config = {
  version: '1.11.0', // PURISTA version

  outputPath: './dist', // output folder
  httpClient: {
    buildAs: 'both', // 'esm' | 'commonjs' | 'both'
    clientName: 'HttpClient' // class name of client
  },
}

const clientBuilder = new ClientBuilder(config)

// generate the source files
await clientBuilder.generateHttpClient(defnitions)

// cleanup the builder and remove event listeners
clientBuilder.destroy()

The context provides also a logger.  
It is highly recommended to use `context.logger` instead of `this.logger`, to ensure correct logging of traces.

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function ({ logger }, payload, parameter) {
  logger.info({ some: 'data'}, 'The log message')
})
  
```

The tenant id is an optional field, which can be set by business logic to the tenant id.
The principal id should be some technical tenant id and not something like an company name, as it might be logged.

The tenant id is propagated down - like the principal id - in the whole process flow. So it will be available in subscriptions and function invocations.

If a input transform is set, it will be executed as very first step in the message handling.  
The input transformer has it's own schemas for input payload and parameters.  
If the schema validation fails, an error response will automatically created and sent back to the caller. The command guards and the command function are not executed, if this validations fails.  
The error will be a `HandledError` with status of `Bad Request`, as the input is not as expected.

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .setTransformInput(z.string(), z.string(), async function (context, payload, parameter) { // [!code ++]
      const payloadParsed = JSON.parse(payload) // [!code ++]
      const parameterParsed = JSON.parse(parameter) // [!code ++]
      return { // [!code ++]
        payload: payloadParsed, // [!code ++]
        parameter:parameterParsed, // [!code ++]
      } // [!code ++]
    }) // [!code ++]
  .setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
    // implement your logic here
  }) 
```

If the transform function itself is throwing an error, other than `HandledError`, a `UnhandledError` with status `Internal Server Error` is sent back to the caller.

If the transformer is used for decryption, and the decryption fails, the transform function should throw a `HandledError` with a status of `Unauthorized` or `Not permitted`.

The transform function must return a object with `payload` and `parameter` property. The type of these two properties is generated and set, based on the command function input schema and command function parameter schema.
Because of this, the input transformer must be defined after the command function schemas.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.013041518f, 0.010865653f, -0.10857628f, -0.043136142f,

PURISTA comes with a default secret store, which can be used as placeholder or connector to config files and environment variables.
In the constructor config, you can add a `config` property. The property must be from type object.

Example:

```typescript
const store = new DefaultSecretStore({
  enableGet: true,
  enableRemove: true,
  enableSet: true,
  config: {
    mySecret: 'secret_value',
  },
})

console.log(store.getSecret('mySecret')) // outputs: secret_value

For example, your command might need to return a _401 Unauthorized_ or _403 Forbidden_.  
This can be done by throwing a [HandledError](../error-handling.md) with corresponding status code set.

The correct error response will already be sent to the client, but the status code is not listed in the OpenApi definition.  
To solve this, you simply use the `addOpenApiErrorStatusCodes` method, to add error response status codes.

```typescript
.addOpenApiErrorStatusCodes(StatusCode.Unauthorized) // [!code ++]
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
  throw new HandledError(StatusCode.Unauthorized)
})

PURISTA heavily utilizes schemas for various purposes. Schemas play a crucial role in validation, TypeScript type generation, and the creation of other structures such as OpenAPI definitions.

While PURISTA offers support for a wide range of schema libraries, particularly thanks to [Typeschema.com](https://typeschema.com/#coverage), it is strongly recommended to utilize [Zod](https://zod.dev/) as the primary schema library. This recommendation is due to the extensive ecosystem surrounding Zod, which enables the implementation of advanced features like OpenAPI schema generation.

It's important to note that only Zod schemas will receive first-class support within PURISTA.

Additionally, we provide a helper function called `extendApi` for Zod schemas, which enables the implementation of various advanced features.

For example:

```typescript
import { extendApi } from '@purista/core'

const mySchema = extendApi(z.object({
  example: extendApi(z.string(), {title: 'An example property', example: 'example value' } ),
}), { title: 'Some description', example: { value: 'example' } })
```

This schema not only includes raw validation and type information but also encompasses descriptions and example values. We leverage these values to enhance the OpenAPI documentation and other automated documentation processes. Moreover, new developers will find helpful explanations and examples directly within the source code.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.014799982f, 0.04812726f, -0.15615883f,

Handled errors are thrown by intention.
These errors are kind of \"Ok, I know there is something wrong, and I give back a proper response\".

Use cases are something like an API call requests an entity by ID, but no entity for a given ID exist, or the requester does not have proper permissions to access the entity.
Also, every failing input validation in PURISTA is a `HandledError`, as we know what happens and how to react.

Example:

An API call is invoking a service function like this:

```typescript
const result = dbRepository.findOne(id)

if (!result) {
  throw new HandledError(StatusCode.NotFound, 'entity not found')
}

```

This will give the client who has called the API endpoint a response with HTTP status code **404 NOT FOUND** and with a payload like this:

```json
{
  \"status\": 404,
  \"message\": \"entity not found\"
}
```

You can provide additional data to that error response:

```typescript
const result = db.findOne(id)

if (!result) {
  throw new HandledError(StatusCode.NotFound, 'entity not found', { id })
}

```

which results in:

```json
{
  \"status\": 404,
  \"message\": \"entity not found\",
  \"data\": {
    \"id\": 1
  }
}
```

::: warning Be aware:
A `HandledError` is only logged in `debug` log level, as it is expected, that this kind of error, is part of the regular business logic, which does not need to get persisted in logs or is used for alerting.

State stores are provided to services during instance creation.

```typescript
const stateStore = new DaprStateStore({ stateStoreName: 'local-state-store' })

const myService = await myV1Service.getInstance(eventBridge, {
    stateStore,
  })
```

The state store is provided inside the `context` of command functions and subscription functions.
It can be used like this:

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload) {

  // set a config
  await context.states.setState('port', 8080)

  // get a config
  const myState = await context.states.getState('hostUrl', 'port')
  console.log(myState) // outputs: { hostUrl: \"http://example.com\", port: 8080 }

  // remove a config
  await context.states.removeState('port')
})
```

::: tip Use schemas to validate
A production ready approach is, to validate the result of store getters against a schema.
It validates the returned values and gives you proper types for further usage in one step.
As an example:

We will use a simple example for better understanding.

![example](/graphic/user_email_example.svg)

- the browser calls the endpoint `/api/v1/sign-up`
- the web server will send a command request `userSignUp` to the event bridge, which is received by an instance of service `User`
- the command `userSignUp` is responding to the web server with the ID of this new created user via the event bridge
- the response of command `userSignUp` is marked with the event name `newUserRegistered`
- the web server will receive the response command `userSignUp` and sends the response back to the browsers
- the service `Email` has a subscription `sendWelcomeEmail` which is listening to all successful calls to `newUserRegistered` command
- the subscription `sendWelcomeEmail` in service `Email` connects to the mail provider and sends the email

Each of these steps is only one single and simple function, which is easy to implement, to understand and to test.
Each of these steps has input-output-validation in place.
Each step has its own error handling and responses are divided into success and error response.
Each step is decoupled from the others.

The different services can be implemented by different developers, which are able to work independently on their feature.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.009031554f, 0.053044382f,

A command is not exposing itself via HTTP.  
To expose commands, you can use [Hono based HTTP server](../../3_eco_system/http_server.md).  
This means we have basically two parts.

1. The web server itself
2. The service instance with the command(s)

Both are communicating over the event bridge.  
In the command builder, you can define the information which is needed to expose a command.
The web server service will build the router and OpenApi definition based on this information.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.006067287f, 0.0913237f, -0.14953986f, -0.05326188f,

PURISTA offers a solution that lets you develop your business logic independently of the infrastructure or major architectural decisions. This means you can focus on building your logic without worrying about how it will fit into your infrastructure setup or future architectural changes.

By decoupling your logic from infrastructure, PURISTA minimizes the risk of vendor lock-in and makes it much easier to migrate to different service providers in the future. This flexibility ensures that your business logic remains agile and adaptable to evolving needs and technologies.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.023853024f, -0.026106494f,

There are two possible ways to mark a command as deprecated.

Commands are automatically marked as deprecated, as soon as the parent service version is marked as deprecated.
In this case, alle commands of this service version are marked as deprecated.

Every command can be marked as deprecated individually by using the `markAsDeprecated` method.

```typescript
.markAsDeprecated() // [!code ++]
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
  // business implementation
})

If you have the need to use other schema and validation libraries, you will need to install some additional dependencies.  
Please have a look at the official documentation of [TypeSchema.com](https://typeschema.com/#coverage) to find the adapter package.

In addition to the TypeSchema adapter, you might need additional packages as well, to convert the validation schema into [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).

Internally, PURISTA is using OpenAPI 3.1/JSON Schema to share interfaces between services.  
As an example, the HTTP server is using the input schema definitions of services, provided in as OpenAPI 3.1/JSON schema.

As an example, to use [Yup](https://yup.dev) schema, you will need to add:

- `yup` itself
- `@typeschema/yup`
- `@sodaru/yup-to-json-schema`', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.017386667f, 0.029948464f, -0.16371284f, -0.0066327886f, 0.07831475f, -0.0052890037f, 0.024520312f, -0.012295608f,

It is quite simple to build a custom secret store.
You can simply extend the `SecretStoreBaseClass` with type parameter of your custom store config.

```typescript
import { 
    SecretStore,
    SecretStoreBaseClass, 
    UnhandledError, 
    StatusCode, 
    StoreBaseConfig 
    type ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray,
  } from '@purista/core'

type CustomStoreConfig = {
  url: string
}

export class CustomStore extends SecretStoreBaseClass<CustomStoreConfig> implements SecretStore {

  private client

  constructor(config: StoreBaseConfig<CustomStoreConfig>) {
    super('CustomStoreName', config)

    this.client = customCLient.connect(this.config.config.url)
  }

  protected async getSecretImpl<SecretNames extends string []>(
    ...secretNames: SecretNames
  ): Promise<ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<SecretNames, string | undefined>> {
    const result: Record<string, string> = {}
    for await (const name of secretNames) {
      try {
        // your custom logic goes here:
        result[name] = await this.client.get(name)
      } catch (err) {
        const msg = `error in secret store getting value ${name}`
        this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
        throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
      }
    }
    return result as ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<SecretNames, string | undefined>
  }

  protected async removeSecretImpl(secretName: string): Promise<void> {
    try {
    // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.del(secretName)
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in secret store removing value ${secretName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  protected async setSecretImpl(secretName: string, secretValue: string) {
    try {
      // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.set(secretName, secretValue)
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in secret store setting value ${stateName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  async destroy() {
    await this.client.disconnect()
    super.destroy()
  }

During unit tests, you will need to mock command invokes.  
PURISTA provides the `getCommandContextMock` in the command builder, which allows to easy mock service invocations.

Only services defined with `canInvoke` are available in the context mock.

```typescript
const context = fooCommandBuilder.getCommandContextMock(payload, parameter, sandbox)

// type/autocomplete is done magically
context.stubs.service.OtherServiceName[1].otherCommandName.resolves({ resultValue: 'the mocked value })

It is quite simple to build a custom config store.
You can simply extend the `ConfigStoreBaseClass` with type parameter of your custom store config.

```typescript
import { 
    ConfigStore,
    ConfigStoreBaseClass,
    UnhandledError, 
    StatusCode,
    StoreBaseConfig,
    type ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray 
  } from '@purista/core'

type CustomStoreConfig = {
  url: string
}

export class CustomStore extends ConfigStoreBaseClass<CustomStoreConfig> implements ConfigStore {

  private client

  constructor(config?: StoreBaseConfig<CustomStoreConfig>) {
    super('CustomStoreName', config)

    this.client = customCLient.connect(this.config.config.url)
  }

  protected async getConfigImpl<ConfigNames extends string[]>(
    ...configNames: ConfigNames
  ): Promise<ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<ConfigNames>> {
    const result: Record<string, unknown> = {}
    for await (const name of configNames) {
      try {
        // your custom logic goes here:
        const value = await this.client.get(name)
        result[name] = value ? JSON.parse(value) : undefined
      } catch (err) {
        const msg = `error in config store getting value ${name}`
        this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
        throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
      }
    }
    return result as ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<ConfigNames>

  }

  protected async removeConfigImpl(configName: string): Promise<void> {
    try {
      // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.del(configName)
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in config store removing value ${configName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  protected async setConfigImpl(configName: string, configValue: unknown) {
    try {
      // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.set(configName, JSON.stringify(configValue))
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in config store setting value ${configName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  async destroy() {
    await this.client.disconnect()
    super.destroy()

The `HttpClient` is a wrapper class around the native `fetch` function.
It provides simple shortcut methods:

- `.get` for GET requests
- `.post` for POST requests
- `.put` for PUT requests
- `.patch` for PATCH requests
- `.delete` for DELETE requests
- `.setBearerToken` set a bearer token to be used for requests

Requests are also automatically added to the current OpenTelemetry trace.
The request header will also contain the standard OpenTelemetry headers. This way the requested server is able to use the tracing information.

Timeout handling is provided out of the box and can be configured in the constructor configuration property.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.013713833f, -0.00080098596f,

You can emit custom JavaScript events in command and subscription functions. They must be prefixed with `misc-`. They can emit any

Example of emitting custom events:

```typescript
.setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
  const customValue = {
    value: 'something'
  }

  this.emit('misc-object', customValue)

  const customValue = {
    value: 'something'
  }

  this.emit('misc-string', 'string_value')
  this.emit('misc-number', 1)
  this.emit('misc-boolean', 1)
})
```

Example of listening for custom events:

```typescript
serviceInstace.on('misc-string', (eventPayload)=> {
    console.log(eventPayload) // outputs: string_value
})
```

::: tip Use enum for custom events
It is recommended, to use your own enum for emitting and listener registration of events.
Your code will become more maintable.

To define path parameters, 2 things are needed.  
First, you need to define the parameter in the url path.  
You simply need to add `:[parameterName]` to your path.

```typescript
.exposeAsHttpEndpoint('GET', 'domain/:id')
```

As path parameters are automatically injected into the parameter object, you need to add the path parameter to the parameter schema.

```typescript
export const theServiceV1PingInputParameterSchema = extendApi(
  z.object({
    id: extendApi(z.string(), { title: 'The id path parameter', example: 'some_id' } )
  }),
  { title: 'The parameter object' },
)
```

::: info Optional path parameters
You can define a path parameter as optional by adding `?` like `'domain/:id'`.  
Do not forget to mark it in the schema as optional `z.string().optional()` or set a default value `z.string().default('some_default')`.

It is quite simple to build a custom state store.
You can simply extend the `StateStoreBaseClass` with type parameter of your custom store config.

```typescript
import { 
    StateStore,
    StateStoreBaseClass,
    UnhandledError,
    StatusCode,
    StoreBaseConfig,
    type ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray,
  } from '@purista/core'

type CustomStoreConfig = {
  url: string
}

export class CustomStore extends StateStoreBaseClass<CustomStoreConfig> implements StateStore {

  private client

  constructor(config: StoreBaseConfig<CustomStoreConfig>) {
    super('CustomStoreName', config, options)

    // your custom logic goes here:
    this.client = customCLient.connect(this.config.config.url)
  }

  protected async getStateImpl<StateNames extends string[]>(...stateNames: StateNames): Promise<ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<StateNames>> {
    if (!this.config.enableGet) {
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.Unauthorized, 'get state from store is disabled by config')
    }

    const result: Record<string, unknown> = {}
    for await (const name of stateNames) {
      try {
        // your custom logic goes here:
        const value = await this.client.get(name)
        result[name] = value ? JSON.parse(value) : undefined
      } catch (err) {
        const msg = `error in state store getting value ${name}`
        this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
        throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
      }
    }
    return result as ObjectWithKeysFromStringArray<StateNames>

  }

  protected async removeStateImpl(stateName: string): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.config.enableRemove) {
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.Unauthorized, 'remove state from store is disabled by config')
    }

    try {
      // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.del(stateName)
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in state store removing value ${stateName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  protected async setStateImpl(stateName: string, stateValue: unknown) {
    if (!this.config.enableSet) {
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.Unauthorized, 'set state at store is disabled by config')
    }

    try {
      // your custom logic goes here:
      await this.client.set(stateName, JSON.stringify(stateValue))
    } catch (err) {
      const msg = `error in state store setting value ${stateName}`
      this.logger.error({ err }, msg)
      throw new UnhandledError(StatusCode.InternalServerError, msg)
    }
  }

  async destroy() {
    await this.client.disconnect()
    await destroy()
  }
}

PURISTA operates on a straightforward message-based system. In this system, there are message senders and receivers. Messages are passed through an event bridge, which connects to a message broker.

The heart of PURISTA's logic lies in its Services, which follow the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Each Service represents a logical grouping of commands and subscriptions that pertain to a specific domain.

Commands are active actions triggered by an external source. When a command is invoked, the caller expects a response. Think of commands as similar to functions in traditional programming languages. The caller knows about the command's existence, its input and output formats, and potentially error responses. However, the caller doesn't need to understand how the command is implemented or executed, nor does it need to know which instance of the service is handling the request.

On the other hand, Subscriptions are passive listeners. When a message matches the criteria defined by a subscription, the subscription is triggered. Importantly, the producer of the message isn't aware of any subscriptions that may be listening.

Commands and subscriptions can invoke other commands within the same or different services by sending command messages. This creates a structured and unified internal interface that allows for clean communication between components. Additionally, this setup provides built-in error handling capabilities, making the system both observable and traceable.

By leveraging this architecture, PURISTA enables the creation of complex setups and scenarios with ease.", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [0.040717617f, 0.0071737454f, -0.1593721f,

Unhandled Errors are more generic errors, where it is not clear, what exactly happened, or how we should handle it.

Let's take an example of a POST endpoint for creating a new Entity.

```typescript
try{
  const result = dbRepository.create(payload)
} catch(err) {
  if (isConstraintViolation(err)) {
    // give the client a propper answer, that he tries to insert a record, but a record with same id already exist
    throw new HandledError(StatusCode.Conflict, 'entity with same id already exist')
  }
  throw new UnhandledError.from(err, StatusCode.InternalServerError)
}

```

As you can see, the error is handled in the sense of _\"Ok there is something wrong, and I log this error, and I prevent the system to crash\"_, but from client side it is more like _\"Ups, something wrong - this should not happen - try again later\"_", textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.0027307894f, 0.014021872f, -0.18042737f, -0.01986304f, 0.049781498f, -0.0438134f, 0.023999246f,

As a service acts as container for comands and subscriptions, it is possible to define resources that can be used by these commands and subscriptions. This allows you to create more generic commands and subscriptions.

A typical example is, to provide a database connection pool which can be used by multiple commands and subscriptions of a service.

Defining a resource needs to be done in the service builder:

```ts
import { Db } from 'my-db'

const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder(serviceOneInfo)
    .setConfigSchema(serviceOneSchema)
    .defineResource('myDB', Db)
```

This adds a new entry `myDB` with type of `Db` to the resource entry of the command & subscription context.

::: warning Definitions vs Instance
In the `defineResource` function, no instance of a resource is provided. Actual instances are set, when a service instance is created.
:::

When a new service instance is created, it requires to get an instance of the resource.

```ts
import { Db } from 'my-db'
const service = await serviceBuilder.getInstance(eventbridge, {
  logger,
  resources: { myDB: new MyDb() },
})
```

The instance can be access via the context of commands and subscriptions.

```ts
commandBuilder.setCommandFunction(async function ({ resource }) {
  return resource.myDB.query('SELECT * FROM my_db')
})

PURISTA provides the client builder, which allows you to create a zero dependency, fetch based REST API client.

The generated client will map the http exposed service commands, similar to the `service` in the context of commands and subscriptions.

```typescript
const client = new HttpClient()

// client.[SERVICE_NAME].v[SERVICE_VERSION].[COMMAND_NAME]
const result = client.foo.v1.bar(payload, parameter)

It is totally fine, if you reduce your error handling in service functions and subscriptions to HandledErrors only.
It is JavaScript/typescript - so just let it throw!

Each service function, and each subscription itself, is wrapped by a try-catch, which will convert any error other than a instance of HandledError, into a UnhandledError with error code 500. The error will be logged. And an error message is send. So no worries, that your whole system can break.

You can create subscriptions to track errors, you have the logs, the user gets a proper response, no information will be leaked.

Because of this, the example from `HandledError` is totally fine, and we do not need to write more code here.
We know that any database issue is handled and returned as **500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR**.', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' }, { embedding: [-0.017334724f, 0.05920582f, -0.17872293f, -0.058936894f,

A service itself does not contain any logic which needs to be tested. It a container/group for commands and subscriptions.

If you use the CLI to generate a service, a simple unit test is generated. This test does not need any changes and only tests for valid configurations.

If you use an custom domain class, you might need to test this class. But be aware, that a service class __should not__ contain business logic.  
Use custom classes to provide something like database connections.

The generated test file might look like this:

```typescript
import { userV1Service as service } from './userV1Service.js'

describe('service user version 1', () => {
  it('has valid setup', () => {
    service.testServiceSetup()
  })
})

```

::: tip
If you have the need to write some unit test for your custom service class implementation, you should not extend the generated file.
Instead create your own test file.

For adding a function to a service, you should use the function builder. It is recommended to use the `getCommandBuilder` method of your service builder instance.

```typescript
const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder.getCommandBuilder(
  'functionName',
  'some function description'
)
```

The command builder is responsible for collecting all information and to provide the type system.

::: warning Order matters
You must declare the input and output schemas before adding transforms, hooks and functions!
As you can see in the diagram above, they impact the input/output types of transforms, hooks and functions.

1. command function payload, parameter and output schema
2. transform schemas
3. other definition
4. command function definition as last one

If you want to make a command accessable via an HTTP endpoint, you need to define the HTTP method and the url path.  

```typescript
import {  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema,  
  myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema,
  myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema,
} from './schema.js'

const myCommandBuilder = myServiceBuilder
  .getCommandBuilder('functionName', 'some function description', 'functionEventEmitted')
  .addPayloadSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputPayloadSchema) 
  .addParameterSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandInputParameterSchema)
  .addOutputSchema(myServiceV1MyCommandOutputSchema)
  .exposeAsHttpEndpoint('GET', 'ping')  // [!code ++]
  .setCommandFunction(async function (context, payload, parameter) {
    // implement your logic here
  })
```

In the example above, we define, that the command is accessable via `GET` method.  
The given path `ping` will result in final url path `/api/v1/ping`.  

The first part `/api` is a configurable value in PURISTA HTTP servers, which defaults to `api`.  
The second part `v1` will be autogenerated, based on the service version - `v[SERVICE_VERSION]`.

::: info ⚠️ Be aware
__GET__ endpoints will not have a payload and the payload schema should be set to `z.undefined()`.

If your command is not returning a value, you should set the output schema to `z.void()`.  
Empty responses are returned with status code _204 No Content_.

Service instances are able to emit regular JavaScript events. This provides a way to observe the service instance, and to decouple things.

As an example:
You like to try out [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) to track certain data.
One way of doing it, would be to directly integrate the Prometheus client into your commands and subscriptions.

But, by doing this, it would add a dependency, directly to your business code, with all the down sides.
A better way is, to emit the data from your command or subscription as regular JavaScript events.
Some function "outside" your service can listen to these events, and process the data.

::: tip PRO

- keeps the business code isolated
- easier to test and to handle errors
- the dependency will be in one place - easier to maintain, fewer duplicate code
- the dependency will become optional - e.g. can simpler replaced by other solutions
:::

::: caution CONTRA

- a bit more overhead at the beginning

Adding subscriptions to a service builder can be done by using the `addSubscriptionDefinition` method.
It takes a single subscription definition as parameter, which will be generated by  the subscription builder.

::: code-group

```typescript [myServiceV1Service.ts]
import type { CommandDefinitionList } from '@purista/core'


import { pingCommandBuilder } from './command/ping/index.js'
import { fooCommandBuilder } from './command/foo/index.js'
import { myServiceV1ServiceBuilder } from './myServiceV1ServiceBuilder'

const commandDefinitions: CommandDefinitionList<any> = [
  pingCommandBuilder.getDefinition(),
  fooCommandBuilder.getDefinition()
]

export const myServiceV1Service = myServiceV1ServiceBuilder
  .addCommandDefinition(...commandDefinitions)
```

```typescript [myServiceV1ServiceBuilder.ts]
import { ServiceBuilder, ServiceInfoType } from '@purista/core'

export const myServiceInfo = {
  serviceName: 'MyService',
  serviceVersion: '1',
  serviceDescription: 'my service',
} as const satisfies ServiceInfoType

export const myServiceV1ServiceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder(myServiceInfo)
```

The additional `const commandDefinitions` is used by the CLI tool!
In regular usecases, you do not need to create or manipulate this file.

The `exposeAsHttpEndpoint` has optional parameters for content type and content encoding, which can be used to handle payloads, which are not JSON content.  

As an example:

```typescript
.exposeAsHttpEndpoint(
  'GET', // HTTP method
  'ping', // url path
  'text/csv', // request content type
  'utf-8', // request content encoding
  'application/pdf',  // response content type
  'utf-8' // response content encoding
)
```

In real-world scenarios, you will need to connect from the outside to your application. You might want to provide a client package, which you want to make public, without sharing your whole internal code.

As PURISTA has the concept of builders, the information about your structure, endpoints, and so on is already available for automation. Because of this, building a client is a two-step process:

1. Extract the information out of your code ([Export service definitions](./export_service_definitions.md))
2. Use the extracted information to generate clients:
   - [REST API client](./create_a_rest_api_client.md)
   - [EventBridge](./create_an_eventbridge_client.md) client
   - [Embedded Client](./embedded_client.md)', textTemplate: '', type: 'TEXT' } ];
