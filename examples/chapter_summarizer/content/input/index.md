# Understanding the Magic

When I first experimented with chatbots based on large language models, I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't because the models were bad; it was because I didn't fully understand their capabilities and possibilities. I was only asking basic questions like "Who is XXX?" or "What is YYY?"

It took me some time to grasp what was truly possible. I started with simple tasks like translations and text corrections. My "wow" moment came when I asked a bot to generate a unit test based on given source code. The bot was faster than me and worked perfectly out of the box. I was blown away and, at the same time, puzzled by how and why it worked so well.

As I kept hearing people say, "I used GPT â€“ look how impressive this is," I thought:

> **How hard could it be to create an AI that can answer questions about PURISTA?**

The answer to that question is: **"Harder than you expect!"**

I tried numerous tools, snippets, packages, and read countless articles, tweets, and posts. I also watched various tutorial videos. However, to truly understand any of these, you need a solid foundation of basic knowledge.

In this chapter, I will provide a rough overview. I will simplify concepts to keep them easy to understand. Understanding the basic ideas and terminology of large language models is essential for developing your own AI.
